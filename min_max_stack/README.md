# Min Max Stack

Write a Min Max Stack class. The class should support pushing and popping values on and off
the stack, peeking at values at the top of the stack, and getting both the minimum and the maximum
values in the stack. All class methods, when considered independently, should run in constant time
and with constant space.

## Time & Space complexity

When considered independently, all operations are constant but the implementation uses $O(n)$ space
as a whole.
